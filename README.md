# SP Neighborhood Map — Nubank Relocation Guide

An interactive map of São Paulo's 96 official districts to help Nubankers evaluate neighborhoods before relocating. Districts are colored by a composite score built from criteria like safety, walkability, distance to the Pinheiros office, rent prices, and public transport access. All weights are adjustable in real time via sliders.

## Features

### Choropleth map
Districts are color-coded from red (low score) to green (high score) using a dynamic scale that stretches to the actual data range. Hover over any district to see its name and composite score; click to open a detailed breakdown.

### Weight sliders
Each scoring criterion has a weight slider (0–5×). Drag any slider and the map recolors instantly, letting you tune the ranking to your personal priorities. A **Reset Weights** button restores all defaults.

### Filter Districts
Set a minimum score per criterion to grey out districts that don't meet your hard requirements. Filtered-out districts appear desaturated on the map so the qualifying ones stand out clearly. A **Reset Filters** button clears all minimums.

### District Detail panel
Click any district to open a sidebar panel showing:
- Composite score
- Per-criterion score bars (visual bar + numeric value)
- Free-text notes (when available in the CSV)
- List of **neighbourhoods (bairros)** within the district

### Compare mode
Click the **Compare** button in the District Detail panel to enter compare mode. Select up to 4 districts using the checkboxes in their detail panels; a horizontal bar chart renders side-by-side scores for all selected districts. Click **Done** or ✕ to exit compare mode.

### CSV data management
| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Edit scores | Open `data/neighborhoods.csv` in any spreadsheet app |
| Reload | **Load CSV** button in the sidebar |
| Export | **Download CSV** button exports the current dataset |

### Map opacity slider
A slider in the sidebar controls the opacity of the choropleth layer (10–100 %), making it easy to see the underlying basemap tiles when needed.

### Collapsible sections
The **Weight Sliders** and **Filter Districts** sidebar sections can be collapsed to save space. They start collapsed by default; click the section header to expand.

## Running locally

You need Python 3 (pre-installed on macOS) or any static file server. **Do not open `index.html` directly as a file** — the app fetches the GeoJSON and CSV at runtime, which requires an HTTP server.

**Clone and run:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedro-luiz-santoro/sp-neighborhood-map.git
cd sp-neighborhood-map
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

**Alternative servers** (if you prefer):

```bash
# Node.js
npx serve .

# Ruby
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080
```

## Scoring criteria

All scores are **1–10** (10 = best for living). The composite score is a weighted average across:

| Criterion | Default weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Distance to Nubank | 2× | 10 = walking distance to Pinheiros office |
| Public Transport | 2× | 10 = direct metro to Oscar Freire (L4), closest station to Nubank |
| Safety | 1.5× | Blended score: homicide rate + street robbery per capita (SSP-SP 2022–2024) |
| Walkability | 1.5× | Pedestrian infrastructure and mixed-use density |
| Low Traffic | 1× | 10 = very low congestion |
| Affordable Rent | 1× | 10 = very affordable |
| Green Spaces | 1× | Parks, trees, squares |
| Affordable Purchase | 0.5× | 10 = very affordable to buy |
| Nightlife | 0.5× | Bars, restaurants, cultural life |
| Family Friendly | 0.5× | Schools, playgrounds, safety for kids |

Districts not present in the CSV default to **5** for all criteria.

## Customizing the data

`data/neighborhoods.csv` is a plain spreadsheet — open it in Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets, edit any scores, save, then use the **Load CSV** button in the sidebar to apply your changes without touching any code.

For full documentation on scoring methodology, data sources, and how each criterion was derived, see [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

If you want to persist your changes for everyone, edit the CSV and open a PR.

## Data disclaimer

The default scores in `data/neighborhoods.csv` were generated with AI assistance and reviewed by a human, but may still contain errors or reflect outdated information. Use them as a starting point — you are encouraged to edit the CSV with your own research and load it back via the **Load CSV** button.
